First, clone the project using :

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Nexus-coder/pet_adoption_app.git
```


## Overview

This is a todo application built using the MERN stack.The project is a really common productivity tool that is used quite frequently.the reason I made it was to further my express javascript skills.

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Express - NodeJS Framework


### What I learned

I have learnt that using react query i have to await the results to comeback so as to use them.
Otherwise is you so not have a loading section and try to lad the data directly it may not work as expected though i am still testing this theory out.
I have also learnt that you cannot render hooks conditionally otherwise they just wont work.
This is something to not on other projets as well another thing to note is what are the drawbacks of using useEffect?
I still have not come to the understanding of this and so I will have to look into it greatly.
Well oterwise it is fun learning and finding this things out for myself.

Question?
 Is it good to have my server side client mangaer which is react query works side by side with the client library this is because for the user experience once a user removes a todo i almost want immediate effect on the removal will react query give me the same effect?
Answer?
 no answer just yet.



### Serving the frontend via the express application
Just build the frontend and serve the assets and build via the express app.

### Organization

### Continued development

I will continue learning on how to make use of the express framework to bring a lot of projects to life and thus it has been a really amazing time learning all the concepts down to even learning how to test using jest.I will continue using the above guides even as I build more web applications that can serve users with a seamless experience while also mainting the best developer practices.

### Useful resources

- [Express Docs](https://expressjs.com/) - This helped me in bringing the express application to life and also searching for the solutions to bugs where I encountered them
